### Our Thesis

The models powering the next generation of technology are complex, opaque, and evolving faster than our ability to understand them. We believe that the path to securing AI starts with truly understanding how it behaves — not just what it produces, but *why*.

What can be understood can be measured. And what can be measured can be made safe.

### Our Team

The hardest problems in AI security aren't solved by people who shy away from complexity. Our team has spent years working at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity, studying the systems others take for granted.

We don't just build tools. We ask the questions most people haven't thought to ask yet.

### Vision

AI will only become more embedded in how we communicate, work, and make decisions. The organizations that thrive won't be the ones that move fastest — they'll be the ones that move with confidence.

We're building toward a future where trust in AI isn't assumed. **It's verified.**
